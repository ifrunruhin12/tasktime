#### 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Docker (Recommended)**: `docker-compose up -d`
2. **Build client**: `go build -o timetask-client ./cmd/client`
3. **Launch client**: `./timetask-client`
4. **Collaborate in real-time!**

**Alternative Local Setup**:
1. `make dev-setup` (requires PostgreSQL)
2. `make server` + `make client`
