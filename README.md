# TimeTask (MVP)

> Dual-mode task management: Personal tasks (local) + Team collaboration (real-time sync)

A modern task management tool built for development teams and individuals. Features both personal task management (stored locally) and real-time team collaboration. Perfect for developers who need both private task tracking and team coordination.

## ✨ Features

- 👤 **Personal Tasks** - Private tasks stored locally, no sync required
- 🚀 **Team Collaboration** - Real-time synchronized team tasks
- 💻 **Beautiful TUI** - Clean terminal interface with dual sections
- ⏱️ **Time Tracking** - Start/stop timers on both personal and team tasks
- 📋 **Task Management** - Create, complete, and delete tasks in both modes
- 🔄 **Live Updates** - WebSocket-powered real-time sync for team tasks
- 🎨 **Color-coded Status** - Visual task states and project tags
- ⚡ **Quick Switching** - Tab between personal and team sections instantly

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ifrunruhin12/timetask.git
cd timetask

# Start everything with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Build and run the client
go build -o timetask-client ./cmd/client
./timetask-client
```

### Option 2: Local Development
```bash
# Prerequisites: Go 1.19+, PostgreSQL 12+
git clone https://github.com/ifrunruhin12/timetask.git
cd timetask

# Quick setup with Make
make dev-setup

# Start server and client (separate terminals)
make server
make client
```

### 3. Use the TUI
- `tab` - Switch between Personal and Team sections
- `n` - Create new task (in current section)
- `d` - Toggle task completion (todo ↔ done)
- `s` - Start/stop timer on selected task
- `x` - Delete task
- `r` - Refresh task list
- `↑/↓` or `j/k` - Navigate tasks
- `q` - Quit

## 📚 API Documentation

Interactive Swagger documentation is available when the server is running:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html
```

The Swagger UI provides:
- 🔍 Complete API reference for all endpoints
- 🧪 Interactive testing interface
- 🔐 Built-in authentication support
- 📝 Request/response examples

**Quick API Test:**
1. Start the server
2. Open `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`
3. Register a user via `/auth/register`
4. Copy the JWT token from the response
5. Click "Authorize" and enter `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`
6. Test any endpoint!

See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for detailed API documentation.

**Personal Tasks**: Stored locally in `~/.tasktime/personal_tasks.json` - never synced
**Team Tasks**: Synchronized in real-time across all connected clients

## 👥 Team Usage

1. **Team lead starts the server**: `docker-compose up -d` (or `make server`)
2. **Everyone runs the client**: `./timetask-client`
3. **Collaborate in real-time**:
   - Create tasks → appear instantly on all screens
   - Start/stop timers → live sync across team
   - Mark tasks complete → everyone stays updated
   - Time accumulates across sessions

## 🛠️ Installation

### Configuration

**Docker (Zero Config)**: Everything works out of the box with `docker-compose up -d`

**Local Development**:
```bash
# Optional environment variables
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://timetask:timetask@localhost/timetask?sslmode=disable"
export PORT="8080"
```
